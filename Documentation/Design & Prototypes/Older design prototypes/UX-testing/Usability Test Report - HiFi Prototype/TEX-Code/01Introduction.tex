\section{Executive summary}
The participants did most of the tasks/scenarios with the minimum amount of clicks needed to complete a task/scenario which indicated that the overall design of the application is understandable and easy to understand. Overall the participants felt that they like the design and that it's clean, easy and contains just the right amount of information. The participants emphasized the importance of a minimalistic design in application for these contexts and believed that it was achieved with this application. All of the participants believed that the initial was informative and contributed to making the navigation easier for a user. This resulted in that participants had much less problems with tasks related to icons of the navigation bar as the guide described what information that can be found behind each icon in the navigation bar. This is also reflected through the improved SUS-score (of 87.5 which is considered to be excellent) in comparison with the previous version which did not consist of an initial guide. Some of the participants had a few tasks which took more clicks than normal to complete due to misunderstanding of the task or, most often, due to the logic of the Goals-page.
