\textbf{POSITIVE} & \textbf{CONSTRUCTIVE} \\
\hline
\hline
I strongly like the fact that the application has a minimalistic design & I think that the icons for Goals and History might be improved \\
\hline
The icons for the Home and Profile page are optimal and represent the content of the pages good & I think it's vital to have a initial guide in the beginning to explain what Streaks are and how to navigate \\
\hline
I believe that the navigation felt natural and I liked the fact that there was not too many options to click on after entering a page & I thought that achievements could be found under the History page \\

\textbf{Test Person} & Participant 1, Female 33  \\
\textbf{SUS Score} & 90/100  \\

\end{tabularx}\\
\\
\textbf{Summarization from scenarios and questions} \\
\noindent Overall the participant had no major issues with navigating through the application and completing the given tasks. The participant commented that the overall logic and navigation felt natural and nothing was out of the ordinary. The participant also liked the trees and gamification features of the application. This is also reflected in the high SUS-score of 90. However, the participant believes that the application needs more color and it should come with an initial guide so that the users can get familiar with the nav-bar icons and what they represent.\\

The participant commented that the overall logic and navigation felt natural and nothing was out of the ordinary. The participant strongly liked the minimalist design features of the application.All of this is reflected in the high SUS-score of 92.5. However, the participant believes that the application needs more gamification and a better icon for the history page (or a guide that teaches users what each icon stands for). The participant had a relatively good understanding of what streaks stands for and compared it with Duolingo.\\

\end{tabularx}\\
\\
\textbf{Summarization from scenarios and questions} \\
\noindent Overall the participant had no major issues with navigating through the application and completing the given tasks. The participant had trouble with some of the tasks and did not fully understand them but could with some explanations proceed as normal. The participant commented that the overall logic and navigation felt natural and nothing was out of the ordinary. The participant strongly liked the minimalist design features of the application and believes that they are a major key to a successful application in these settings. All of this is reflected in the high SUS-score of 90. However, the participant believes that the icon for the goals page could be misinterpreted and does not reflect what itâ€™s content is and should therefore be seen over (or implement  a guide that teaches users what each icon stands for).  The participant had an good understanding of what streaks mean.\\

\subsection{Test 4}

\noindent\rule{15.1cm}{0.4pt}\\
\\
\begin{tabularx}{0.6\textwidth}{ >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X  }
\textbf{Date}: & 21/11  \\
\textbf{Location}: & Remote  \\
\textbf{Test Leader}: & Fredrik Thorsson  \\
\textbf{Test Person} & Participant 4, Male 56  \\
\textbf{SUS Score} & 60/100  \\

\end{tabularx}\\
\\
\textbf{Summarization from scenarios and questions} \\
\noindent It was generally hard for the test person to overview the application and its content. Icons didnâ€™t match the participants' recognition, which made it hard to navigate through the application. The language was a contributory factor for the difficulties the participant encountered. Words as gamification and streaks were completely new to the test person. The star icon was associated with favorites.\\

\noindent\textbf{Results from test scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The participant understood the icon for the profile page and could easily change his password.
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: average
\item The participant could instantly see the upcoming measurement on the home page to enter a new value for blood sugar levels.
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: average
\item The participant finds it easy to edit his done measurement from the home page.
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: average
\item The participant had because of lacking english skills problems with finding the relative settings. After explanation the participant thought it was logic. 
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: more than average
\item The participant didnâ€™t associate the star icon with goals. Instead he thought it was somehow related to favorites. 
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: more than average
\item The participant easily found the history page and could with no problems find this registered activity value. 
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: average
\item Again the participant had problems with associating the star with goals. After entering the goals page the participant had some issues with locating the achievements button.
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: more than average
\item The participant went to the help page to find information about the help page. He searched for information explaining what the trees are used for. He didnâ€™t think it was sufficient information just clicking on the oak sapling. 
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: more than average
\item The participant could easily find where to change the gamification levels.
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: average
\item Again the participant had issues with the star icon. After entering the goals page the participant first went to achievements. 
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: more than average
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Test 5}

\begin{tabularx}{0.6\textwidth}{ >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X  }
\textbf{Date}: & 21/11  \\
\textbf{Location}: & Remote  \\
\textbf{Test Leader}: & Fredrik Thorsson  \\
\textbf{Test Person} & Participant 4, Male 56  \\
\textbf{SUS Score} & 80/100  \\

\end{tabularx}\\
\\
\textbf{Summarization from scenarios and questions} \\
\noindent Would like to use the application if there was a need, like the purpose. Could take some time to learn the application, but after using it a while the layout feels logical. Understood the term streak. Had never heard the word gamification before. The icons for history and goals don't feel logical, relating the star to favorites. The layout of the home page together with the navigation bar gives the user a good overview.  \\

\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: average
\item The participant didnâ€™t agree with the chosen icon for history, however he could find the page and see his registered activity values.
\subitem \textbf{Amount of clicks}: average
